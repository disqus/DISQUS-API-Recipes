# DISQUS API Recipes

A cookbook of common recipes to help expedite your development process when using the DISQUS API.

## List

1. List 100 most active users and comment counts: list-100-most-active-users.php (forums/listMostActiveUsers)
2. Get an SSO account's username: get-sso-username.php (users/details)
3. Get a thread's details: get-thread-details.php (threads/details)
4. List all threads created between a given date and now: list-all-threads-between-date-and-now.php (threads/list)
5. Create a guest comment: create-guest-comment.php (posts/create)

## Requirements

* PHP, preferably 5.3.8+
* (Optional) [DISQUS API bindings for PHP](https://github.com/disqus/disqus-php) — none of these .php files require the bindings. Only use the bindings if you know you need them and already know how to use them.

## Usage

Run any of these files from your PHP installation. Enjoy!

## Requests

[Email us any requests](http://disqus.com/support).

Note: The integrity and utility of these recipes is very important to us. This means keeping them tidy and aimed at a wide audience. If you request a very specific recipe we may make it less specific so it's more accessible.

## Support

These recipes are meant as a starting point, so most recipes have only been tested to work with PHP 5.3.8 in Chrome 17+.
